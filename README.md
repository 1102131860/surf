# Summer Undergraduate Research Fundings (SURF) Project
This is a multi-sensors project which conations the MAX30102 (PPG sensor), AD8232 (ECG sensor), ADX355 (IMU), and ESP32-Wroom MCU.

It aims to obtain basic light signal reflected by vessels, electrical signal generated by skin conduction, and heart fibrillation led by breathing to build a physiological model with heart rhythm, blood oxygen saturation, blood pressure and etc.

In this stage, it achieves the wireless data transmission through wifi and uploading data message to Aliyun IoT platform and database with tiny time delay.

It also implements the basic heart rhythem and blood oxygen calculation at the level of MCU to real-timely reflect the result to users.
